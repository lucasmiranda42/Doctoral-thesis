\section{Overview}

Once the presented algorithms were implemented and packaged in DeepOF, there came the time to apply them to a real-world dataset. The model of choice, as introduced in chapter \ref{chap:introduction}, was Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS), a widely adopted animal model on chronic stress and depression research. This acted as a positive control, where we had a clear idea of the expected shifts to detect, which would serve as validation for the provided package. Moreover, as significant symptoms of MDD are the deterioration of social functionality and a decline in social motivation, it also served as a good platform to test the detection of social interaction alterations in several ways.

Along these lines, the current chapter includes our paper titled \emph{Automatically annotated motion tracking identifies a distinct social behavioral profile following chronic social defeat stress}, published in \emph{Nature Communications} \cite{Bordes2023AutomaticallyStress}. In short, we here show how DeepOF can identify distinct stress-induced social and individual behavioral patterns, relying on both the annotation of pre-defined traits, and on unsupervised segmentation using the models presented in chapter \ref{chap:methods} \footnote{As introduced already in previous chapters, DeepOF offers three different encoder-decoder architectures (recurrent, TCN, transformers) and three time series segmentation approaches (VaDE, VQVAE, Contrastive+HMM). All results presented in this paper, however, relied on VaDE models with graph-like inputs and recurrent encoders/decoders. Results using other models did not substantially modify what was obtained, except for graph-input VQVAEs, which often diverged during training.}. Moreover, analyzing how global embedding shifts evolve over time reveals how these patterns are particularly noticeable at the onset of a novel social interaction, though they tend to diminish over time due to habituation in social settings.

We apply DeepOF to a variety of experimental settings, including single-animal open fields, social interaction (for which we use both single and multi-animal embeddings), and social avoidance tasks, and compare and interpret how the detected patterns vary across settings. Furthermore, while traditional social avoidance tasks (a set of univariate measures introduced in chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}) can detect stress-induced social behavioral differences, both supervised and unsupervised DeepOF pipelines offer a more comprehensive and detailed profile, which in addition requires lower experimental effort. Last but not least, a comprehensive statistical and visual interpretation of retrieved clusters is included.

\section{Contribution to the work}

I was the sole contributor of the DeepOF package, whose implementation was presented in the previous chapter and application is presented here. Moreover, I had the leading role in analyzing all the data presented in this chapter. Main figures 1 (except for mice drawings), 6, 7, as well as supplemental figures 1, 2, and 5--17 were conceived, designed, and coded by me. I did not take part in any of the animal experiments involved. I also wrote the full text in the manuscript (together with co-lead Joeri Bordes). First author order in the authors' list was randomized.

\newpage

The work presented here would not have been possible without the help and support of Benno Pütz (my great mentor and travel companion), Joeri Bordes (whose hard work and contributions were invaluable in conceiving and implementing DeepOF and its applications), Mathias V. Schmidt, and, of course, Bertram, who let me make my own path and explore interdisciplinary collaborations, while always being there for me.

Along these lines, I feel the need to highlight the beautiful collaborative atmosphere within the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry and the International Max Planck Research School for Translational Psychiatry (IMPRS-TP). Most (if not all) of my work was sparked by interactions with other research groups within these institutions, where complementary expertise and the learning of a common language were (and continue to be) key to reaching our humble goals. Special thanks to Darina Czamara and Juan Pablo Lopez, who supported me with advice and presented me with opportunities at all times, and to Elisabeth Binder.

On top of this, I was fortunate enough to have been part of the Machine Learning Frontiers in Precision Medicine Marie Curie Innovative Training Network (MLFPM-ITN). Here, people like Felix Agakov, Karsten Borgwardt, Katharina Heinrich, and many others, made sure I and all students had everything we needed to thrive in our own individual and collective scientific endeavors. For this I am immensely grateful.

Last but not least, I thank my friends and family back home. Their unconditional support, love, and company in the distance were key to finding motivation, especially through the difficult times many of us endured in isolation over the last couple of years.
